Scripts helps me in my current work in the field of trade

The scripts work with xls, xlsx and ods files, so additional libraries (modules) may be required for their operation.

You may need to install:

```
pip3.12 install --upgrade pip
pip3.12 install pandas
pip3.12 install tqdm
pip3.12 install xlrd
pip3.12 install openpyxl
pip3.12 install odfpy
```
